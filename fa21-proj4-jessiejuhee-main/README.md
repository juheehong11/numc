### Provide answers to the following questions.
- How many hours did you spend on the following tasks?
  - Task 1 (Matrix functions in C): 
  10 ish hours.
  - Task 2 (Speeding up matrix operations): 
  15 ish hours. 
- Was this project interesting? What was the most interesting aspect about it?
  - Yes; I liked the optimisation parts -- it helped me explore different ways of optimising the 
  operations and also made me more familiar with using SIMD and OpenMP, which previous to doing this project I was feeling a little unconfident in using. 
- What did you learn?
  - Quite a lot of different things; mostly how to actually really use SIMD functions, and many different ways of trying to speed up a multiplication operation esp. because I spent so much time on it trying to raise the speed up values. 
- Is there anything you would change?
  - Not really. All the basic arithmetic operations are covered (in optional format for some), so I think that's good. Maybe add in how to compute determinents for a challenge? 2x2 and 3x3 should be easy but for larger matrices they can be challenging.
